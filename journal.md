my thoughts on the new cell phone use poloicy is that it's useless. I don't have any problem with adjusting with it but others do, there are lots of instances where we might need ourt phones. An example would be like what if there is and emergency and the school phone is down or they cant reach them in time, having our phone and just being able to contact our parents would be faster and more efficient. There are lots of other instances where we might need our phones aswell and there are a lot of people teachers and students that agree with this. The bill even affects teachers because some of their classes were centered on using cellular devices to connect to things like apps. The evidencve i provided helps prove how the phone ban does more harm than good.

I think that working in a virtual store can be a good idea as long as youre getting money. earning 61 dollars for just working in an online store without having to get up for a real one can have lots of benefits like if you can't make it to the actual store.

a good use of AI could be to make it to where students can pitch different ideas to an AI program that they might not have the materials to do and have it create it. This idea meets the requirements becasue it shows an idea that student can use oout of the benefit of AI. The idea could help people by getting to see their ideas live on a screen instead of being left thinking about what it could be.

some technology that could help the people would be a tracker for after the storm. The tracker could help them discover people who could have gotten lost in the storm.This tool coould help prevent the amount of people missing and save the ives of thousands if used correctly.If i could make a new pience of technology it would be a weather preventer to stop certain weather or prevent it as much as possible.I feel that would help with current situations.
